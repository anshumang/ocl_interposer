The structure of the repo is this-
--test_app.c
--Makefile (make app to  build test_app.out)
--client_server_common_includes.h
--client
  --- client.cpp
  --- client_only_includes.h
  --- Makefile (make client to build libCLInterposerClient.so.1.0.1)
--server
  ---server.cpp
  ---Makefile (make server to build server.out)

RUN HOWTO (Only shiva tested)
----------------------------
Launch ./server.out on shiva or ifrit
Export LD_PRELOAD on the client machine (shiva or ifrit) to point to libCLInterposerClient.so.1.0.1
Launch ./test_app.out on the client machine (shiva or ifrit)

The dependency on shiva or ifrit is the hardcoded paths in the Makefiles for where the Nvidia tools are installed.
